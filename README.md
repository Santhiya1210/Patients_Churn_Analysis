# Patients_Churn_Analysis

# Project Overview
This project analyzes Patient Churn data using SQL to understand patient retention, satisfaction levels, and churn behavior.

# Objectives
Analyze overall churn rate and patient distribution.
Study churn based on satisfaction, tenure, and visits.
Identify patterns related to billing issues and insurance type.
Provide actionable business insights to reduce churn.

# Tools Used
MySQL – Data querying and analysis.
SQL – Aggregations, filtering, and insights generation.

# Data Modeling
Single structured dataset used for analysis.
Churned column considered as target variable.
Aggregated metrics calculated using SQL queries.

# Key Metrics
Total Patients: (Based on dataset)
Total Churned Patients: (Calculated using SQL)
Churn Percentage: (Derived metric)
High-Risk Group: Low tenure & low satisfaction patients.

# Key Insights
Low satisfaction strongly increases churn risk.
Patients with fewer visits are more likely to churn.
Billing issues contribute significantly to churn.
Low-tenure patients show higher churn probability.

# Conclusion
The analysis highlights key factors influencing patient churn, including satisfaction levels, visit frequency, and billing issues. By addressing these areas, healthcare providers can improve patient retention and reduce churn effectively.
